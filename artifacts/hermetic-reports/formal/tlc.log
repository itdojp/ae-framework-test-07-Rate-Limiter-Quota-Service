Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2026-02-16 06:36:03.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 3.8E-11
87358 states generated, 8859 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 25.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 18 and the 95th percentile is 3).
